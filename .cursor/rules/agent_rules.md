# Agent collaboration rules (repo-local)

## Primary goals

- Prefer **small, incremental changes** and verify behavior as you go.
- Avoid refactors unless required for the task.
- Keep files focused (Single Responsibility), and prefer smaller functions.

## Project conventions

- Prefer **TypeScript** and existing patterns in `src/`.
- When adding non-trivial features, write a short tech spec in `.cursor/docs/`.
- Update `.cursor/notes/project_checklist.md` and `.cursor/notes/notebook.md` as work progresses.

## Working style

- Ask when intent is unclear, especially around product behavior.
- Don’t introduce new dependencies unless necessary.
- Keep changes readable and reviewable.
