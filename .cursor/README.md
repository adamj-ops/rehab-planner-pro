# Cursor Agent Workspace

This `.cursor/` folder is **internal developer/agent documentation** for this repo. It is not end-user facing.

## Structure

- `rules/`: Rules and conventions the agent should follow while working in this repo.
- `tools/`: Helper scripts and utilities that make agent work more productive.
- `docs/`: Technical specs / design docs (non end-user facing).
- `notes/`: Ongoing working notes and checklists (living documents).
- `skills/`: Specialized agent skills for frontend design and project development.

## Required notes

The following files are intentionally kept as simple, living documents:

- `notes/project_checklist.md`: Continuously updated plan with steps, progress, and status.
- `notes/notebook.md`: Ongoing record of useful findings, decisions, and debugging notes.
- `notes/agentnotes.md`: Critical information for future agent sessions (structure, conventions, gotchas).
